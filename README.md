### Installation
- Make sure you have curl installed
```bash
sudo pacman -S curl --needed
```
- Run the installer script
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arpansource/ashar/main/ashar.sh | bash
```

### Core Principles

- **üöÄ Performance First** - Lightweight, blazing-fast applications that don't waste resources
- **‚å®Ô∏è Terminal-Centric** - TUI over GUI wherever possible. The terminal is your home
- **üé® Aesthetic Minimalism** - Beautiful doesn't mean bloated. Clean, focused, distraction-free
- **‚ö° Developer-Optimized** - Built by developers, for developers. Fast compile times, instant feedback
- **üîß Intentional Choices** - Every app serves a purpose. No redundancy, no bloat

## üí° Why ASHAR?

This isn't your typical eye-candy rice with animations and transparency everywhere. ASHAR is designed for:

- Developers who **live in the terminal**
- Users who prefer **keyboard over mouse**
- Systems where **every millisecond matters**
- Workflows that demand **maximum efficiency**

If you want fancy effects and GPU-intensive animations, look elsewhere. If you want a **snappy, responsive system** that gets out of your way and lets you work, you're in the right place.

## üé® Features

- üñ•Ô∏è **TUI-First Approach** - Terminal applications are prioritized for speed and efficiency
- ‚ö° **Performance Optimized** - Carefully selected lightweight alternatives to bloated software
- üéØ **Developer Workflow** - Keybindings and tools optimized for coding and productivity
- üåà **Minimal Aesthetics** - Clean, focused interface without unnecessary visual clutter
- üîã **Resource Efficient** - Perfect for older hardware or extending battery life
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Keyboard-Driven** - Mouse usage minimized, everything accessible via keybindings

## üöÄ Performance-Focused Application Stack

ASHAR replaces common resource-heavy applications with lightweight, performant alternatives:

| Instead of... | ASHAR uses... | Why? |
|---------------|---------------|------|
| Chrome / Firefox | **Brave** | Privacy-focused, faster, less RAM usage |
| VSCode / Cursor / Windsurf | **Zed** | Native performance, instant startup, minimal memory footprint |
| GNOME Terminal / Konsole | **Alacritty** | GPU-accelerated, fastest terminal emulator available |
| Node.js | **Bun** | 3x faster runtime, drop-in replacement with better performance |
| Electron Apps | **Native Alternatives** | No bloated web wrappers, true native performance |

### TUI Applications (Terminal User Interface)

Where others use GUI apps, ASHAR leverages powerful TUI alternatives:

- **btop** - System monitor (replaces GUI task managers)
- **lazygit** - Git interface (replaces GitKraken, GitHub Desktop)
- **ranger/yazi** - File manager (TUI alternative to GUI file browsers)
- **ncmpcpp** - Music player (lightweight audio control)
- **newsboat** - RSS reader (stays in terminal)

> **Note:** You're free to install heavier alternatives (Chrome, VSCode, etc.) anytime. ASHAR simply provides optimized defaults.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Who Is This For?

### ‚úÖ Perfect For:
- Backend developers and systems programmers
- DevOps engineers and sysadmins
- Power users who live in the terminal
- Users with older hardware seeking modern performance
- Anyone tired of bloated development environments
- Minimalists who appreciate functional beauty

### ‚ùå Not For:
- Users who prefer GUI-heavy workflows
- People seeking maximum visual effects and animations
- First-time Linux users (intermediate knowledge recommended)
- Those who need Adobe Creative Suite or Windows-only software


### KNOWN Quirks
- If zed fails starting try running it with --foreground option `zed . --foreground`
- If the logs show -- `Unable to init GPU context: Platform(Init(ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED))` then try installing vulkan drivers for you Graphic. for intel -- `vulkan-intel`
